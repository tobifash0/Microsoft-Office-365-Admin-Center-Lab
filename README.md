# Home Lab Microsoft Office 365

## Overview: Understanding Office 365 Home lab
This repository documents my home lab project focused on exploring and understanding Office 365 within a lab environment. The lab covers setting up and configuring Office 365 services, managing user accounts, and exploring key features like calendar management. As part of the calendar management, the project also covers configuring calendar permissions, delegating access rights, and setting up shared calendars to ensure proper access control.

## Objectives
- Set up and configure Office 365 services to understand the foundational components of a cloud-based productivity environment.
- Manage user accounts to explore user creation, roles, permissions, and account lifecycle within Office 365.
- Explore key features like calendar management to gain insights into scheduling, event organization, and collaboration tools.
- Configure calendar permissions and delegate access rights to ensure precise control over calendar visibility and editing capabilities.
- Set up shared calendars to facilitate effective team communication and resource management.

## Documentation
In this lab we will focus on how to use and manage Office 365 and explore the different features it has. We can try Microsoft Office 365 for free for one month through their website. After entering our information, we should be able to access and use it for our own lab.

In Teams, we can collaborate seamlessly through chats, group discussions, and scheduling meetings. Finally, the Subscriptions section allows us to manage payment methods, view invoices, and monitor license usage for active subscriptions.
